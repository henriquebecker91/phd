  * A detailed description of the discretization method.
  * Future works.

* What will be covered in the paper? There will be only 10 pages.
  * The description of the problem.
  * The description of Furini's original model, and the changes made by us.
  * The original preprocessing done by Furini.
  * The proof we can shorten the second child plates without losing optimality.
  * The proof our changes to the Furini's model do not harm correcteness.
  * Diagrams of packings that do not happen in our model.
    * Proof they do always have an alternative layout.
  * Explain the weakness of our model (hard to warm-start).
  * Consider comparing the technique to a reverse column generation?
  * Experimental results:
    * We only use one thread, as they do.
    * Do we need to say that solver times greatly vary with the seed?
    * Our re-implementation match the number of plates and variables.
    * Our revised implementation greatly reduces the number of variables.
    * The shortening of the second child works for both.
    * The times of them in the same computer, with the same solver are considerably different.
    * The Furini's method of reducing variables may be applied in a simplified fashion and reduces even more variables.
    * A direct comparison between our method and Furini's priced method is not possible (by lack of re-implementation) but our method seems to use far less variables.
      * Hard to warm-start, and the hardcoded heuristic throws away part of the usefulness of using a model.
    * Should we try to execute over the Velasco and Uchoa instances too?
      * We could prove some optimal values, which is of theoretical interest, but at the same time, there is too many things in this paper.

* To make a direct comparison with the priced model I would have to adapt the warm start procedure, and yet the procedure would not be exactly the same (because we do not go adding variables one-by-one). So the best is to make a indirect comparison, if something is to be done.
* As I do not need to warm-start variables, I may use JuMP 0.19, with direct model, and without deleting any variables, just fixing and unfixing them, and the use last versrion of CPLEX with it.
* The server to be used is the OCA. I need to collect its info to put in the paper.

Runs for the experiments:
  * --faithful2furini --no-{cut-position,redundant-cut}
    * Consider excluding this run. Only necessary for creating factor between times of the original paper and the ones from this paper.
  * --faithful2furini
  * --faithful2furini --round2disc
  * (empty)

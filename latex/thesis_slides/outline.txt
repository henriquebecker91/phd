Use the same system of outlines previously used in the masters.

* We need to explain the main problem (G2KP) clearly.
* There is the condensed definition, that there is probably should be used.
* Images for explaining every modifier? (this would be mostly for Ritt)
* Above the image the definition of the specific modifier?

Motivation and contribution were not described by slides in the masters.

It seems that the related work needs to be considerably simplified.
	* Not sure if the relation with different problems is relevant enough to be presented.
	* The full description of the instances may probably be ommited too.

IDEA: describe the discretization process, and then from it describe the two main improvements: no cut after the midplate, plate-size normalization, this way we marge contributions and the discretization/normalization part, giving a hook for the model changes.
Create images to describe the discretization
	* Show how the second half of a plate often has more discretized points
	* Show how the difference between piece combination and the plate dimensions is always waste.
	* Show how different kinds of plates are may be all compressed to the same by the plate normalization.
	* Give a graphical explanation on the cyclical effect of removing cut positions?
	* Maybe a slide acknowledging another types of discretizations and pointing why they were not used.

Hook to the model changes: normalization is transparent to the model, the no-cut-after-midplate needs adjusts in the model.
	* Show slide with Furini Model?
	* Show slide with our modifications in blue.
	* Proof of correctness may be ignored. We may say during the presentation that it is present in the text.

Setup section is ignored.

Create one slide for the pricing?
	* Maybe put it in the middle of the experiments, when it starts to be relevant.
	* Very high level description of the whole procedure.

Probably we need one slide at the start of the experiments describing the three data sources (and putting them in different colors?)

Get the main table of each subsetction. Explain the reason for the experiment and the results from it (not sure if an auxiliary slide should or not be used.)

Skip conclusions? Or at least give a slide with the summary of the results (note: without this we do not have any slide talking about the new optimals from the Velasco and Uchoa instances).

Slide presenting the two tracks.
	* One slide describing the multiple problems we can adapt the formulation to.
	* One slide describing the reasons for a systematic approach.
	* One slide for the alternative research possibilities, or one for possibility? If it is one for possibility we have to increase the central tracks number  of slides.

Plan of action?

What was already done in the meantime?
